# My Journey Through CS2030: Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming

## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through the CS2030 course at the National University of Singapore (NUS), focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP). As a student in the Department of Computer Science, I'm excited to delve into these crucial programming paradigms and share my learning progress, challenges, and achievements.

## Course Overview

CS2030 at NUS offers an in-depth exploration of OOP and FP. The course aims to equip students with a solid understanding of both paradigms, emphasizing their practical application in solving complex problems and software design.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Basics of OOP**: Understanding objects, classes, encapsulation, and more.
- **Advanced OOP Techniques**: Inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces.
- **Introduction to FP**: Concepts of pure functions, immutability, and functional interfaces.
- **Advanced FP Concepts**: Exploring higher-order functions, lazy evaluation.
- **Design Patterns and Best Practices**: Learning about software design patterns in both OOP and FP.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal documentation of my learning journey, suggestions, and discussions from fellow students or programming enthusiasts are always welcome!

## Acknowledgements

A heartfelt thank you to the course instructors and my peers at NUS for their support and guidance throughout this learning journey.
